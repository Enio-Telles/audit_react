## 2026-04-10 - Optimize Polars multiple counts on same DataFrame
**Learning:** In Polars, calculating multiple counts or aggregates on the same DataFrame by chaining `df.filter(...).height` forces redundant dataset scans.
**Action:** Use a single `df.select()` containing multiple `.sum()` aggregations on boolean expressions (e.g., `(pl.col('col') == val).sum().alias('count')`) to process all metrics concurrently in a single pass.
## 2026-04-12 - Pre-compile React UI rules into useMemo hook
**Learning:** When applying dynamic rules across large datasets in React (e.g., evaluating highlight rules per table cell), executing `.toLowerCase()` and `parseFloat()` directly inside the render loop causes redundant O(N*M) allocations.
**Action:** Pre-compile the rule configurations inside a `useMemo` hook to cache parsed variables before iterating the dataset.
## 2026-04-14 - Consolidating React functional array methods
**Learning:** Chaining functional array methods like `.filter()` and `.reduce()` repeatedly on the same array in React rendering cycles significantly compounds O(N) performance degradation, especially when nested inside computationally heavy logic loops.
**Action:** Replace chained `.filter()` and `.reduce()` logic into a single `for...of` loop to traverse the array exactly once, calculating all aggregates simultaneously.
