## 2026-03-26 - React Derived State Performance
**Learning:** Derived state like `Array.filter` applied to large arrays (e.g. `PRODUTOS_EXEMPLO`) directly in render causes O(N) operations on every render, lagging UI when unrelated state updates (e.g. selecting a row or typing).
**Action:** Always wrap expensive list operations (filters, sorts, sets) in `useMemo` and hoist string operations like `toLowerCase()` out of the iteration loop.
