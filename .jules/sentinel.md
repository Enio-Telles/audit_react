## 2024-05-24 - Overly Permissive CORS Configuration
**Vulnerability:** The CORS configuration in `backend/main.py` used insecure wildcards (`*`) for allowed methods and headers, and hardcoded `localhost` origins, increasing the risk of CSRF and unauthorized cross-origin requests.
**Learning:** Default FastAPI examples often use `allow_methods=["*"]` and `allow_headers=["*"]` for convenience during development, which can accidentally leak into production.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly list allowed HTTP methods (e.g., `['GET', 'POST']`) and allowed headers (e.g., `['Content-Type', 'Authorization']`). Fetch allowed origins dynamically from environment variables rather than hardcoding them.
