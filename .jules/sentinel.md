## 2024-05-24 - Overly Permissive CORS Configuration
**Vulnerability:** The CORS configuration in `backend/main.py` used insecure wildcards (`*`) for allowed methods and headers, and hardcoded `localhost` origins, increasing the risk of CSRF and unauthorized cross-origin requests.
**Learning:** Default FastAPI examples often use `allow_methods=["*"]` and `allow_headers=["*"]` for convenience during development, which can accidentally leak into production.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly list allowed HTTP methods (e.g., `['GET', 'POST']`) and allowed headers (e.g., `['Content-Type', 'Authorization']`). Fetch allowed origins dynamically from environment variables rather than hardcoding them.

## 2024-05-25 - Arbitrary File Write via Unvalidated Output Directory
**Vulnerability:** The `output_dir` provided by the user in `fisconforme.py` was used directly with `Path(output_dir).expanduser()` to save files, allowing arbitrary file writes anywhere on the system.
**Learning:** Internal tool features like "save to custom directory" must be confined to a safe base directory when implemented in a web backend to prevent path traversal and arbitrary writes.
**Prevention:** Always validate user-provided paths by checking for `..`, resolving them safely against a predefined base directory, and enforcing `.is_relative_to(safe_base)`.

## 2024-05-26 - Arbitrary SQL Execution via Raw Query Input
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/sql/execute` endpoint accepted arbitrary SQL strings from the frontend and executed them directly against the Oracle database, creating a critical risk of SQL injection and unauthorized data access.
**Learning:** Endpoints designed to execute "predefined" or "cataloged" SQL should never accept the raw SQL text from the client, as the client can easily be bypassed or manipulated.
**Prevention:** Always pass an identifier (like `sql_id`) from the client to the server, and let the server fetch the trusted SQL content from a secure, read-only catalog before execution.
