## 2024-05-18 - [Path Traversal in Parquet File Reading]
**Vulnerability:** A path traversal vulnerability existed in the `/api/tabelas/{cnpj}/{nome_tabela}` endpoint where `nome_tabela` was used to directly construct a file path for `.parquet` files using `pathlib.Path`. While `pathlib` concatenates strings, calling `.resolve()` would allow resolving out to external files (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd.parquet` if that file existed).
**Learning:** Even though `nome_tabela` had an implicit format assumption, FastApi path parameters allow url encoded slash traversal strings if not properly checked. In `pathlib`, simply joining `BASE_DIR / ... / f"{user_input}.parquet"` does not prevent path traversal if the user input contains `../`.
**Prevention:** Always validate that the dynamically generated file path, after resolution, remains within the expected base directory. You can enforce this in python using `try: resolved_path.relative_to(base_dir.resolve()) except ValueError: raise InvalidPath()`.

## 2025-02-27 - Insecure CORS Configuration
**Vulnerability:** Overly permissive CORS configuration (`allow_origins=["*"]`) combined with `allow_credentials=True`.
**Learning:** This combination allows any domain to make cross-origin requests with credentials, which is insecure and invalid under strict browser specifications. It was likely left open during early development.
**Prevention:** Always restrict CORS origins to trusted domains, ideally by reading them from an environment variable (e.g. `CORS_ORIGINS`) with safe localhost defaults for development. Ensure `allow_origins` does not use the wildcard `*` when `allow_credentials` is set to `True`.

## 2025-02-27 - Overly Permissive CORS Headers and Methods
**Vulnerability:** The CORS configuration in FastAPI was using wildcards `["*"]` for `allow_methods` and `allow_headers`.
**Learning:** This combination allows potentially dangerous HTTP methods or custom headers when `allow_credentials=True`. It violates the Principle of Least Privilege and opens the door to cross-origin abuse and unexpected behaviors.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly define the required headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, `Accept`) and methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`) instead of using a wildcard.
